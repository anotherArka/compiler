# Compiler
Trying to build a compiler in Haskell. And some other bits of code.

## Untyped.hs
An interpreter of untyped lambda calculus. I have already written the basic code 
consisting of substitution operation and evaluation. 

### Next Goal
Write whatever small documentation is needed. And also an REPL.

### Contradiction.hs
Contains a derivation of type Void in Haskell

###DFA_to_Regex.idr
Contains code to convert DFA to Regex
